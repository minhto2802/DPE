### Overview

Subpopulation shifts arise when subgroup distributions differ between training and deployment. We introduce **Diversified Prototypical Ensemble (DPE)**, a technique that augments any pretrained feature extractor with a set of prototype classifiers optimized for diversity. DPE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art robust methods across **nine real-world datasets** without requiring subgroup labels.

### Why This Matters

- No subgroup annotations required
- Improves worst-group accuracy (WGA) across vision, language, and healthcare
- Scalable and modular: can be applied post hoc to any trained model
